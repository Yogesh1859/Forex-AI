    <h1>About Forex AI</h1>

    <p>Forex AI is an innovative platform designed to provide accurate financial market insights using advanced AI algorithms. 
    This project is developed as part of our college curriculum at <strong>Panimalar Engineering College</strong> to demonstrate the application of artificial intelligence in financial technology.</p>

    <p>The main aim of this project is to create a smart system that helps traders make informed decisions by analyzing large amounts of Forex market data in real-time. 
    It simulates the process of predicting currency trends using AI models, which can save time and reduce the risk of human error.</p>

    <p>Our team at Panimalar Engineering College has worked extensively to integrate features such as AI prediction, historical data tracking, and user-friendly dashboards. 
    The project also emphasizes the importance of clean UI/UX design to ensure that users can navigate and access critical information easily.</p>

    <p>Forex AI is designed to be educational, demonstrating how artificial intelligence can be applied in practical scenarios. 
    Students and beginners can learn about market trends, AI algorithms, and data visualization techniques through this project. 
    It serves as both a learning tool and a functional prototype.</p>

    <p>Features of this project include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Real-time market trend prediction using AI.</li>
      <li>Historical data analysis and visual representation.</li>
      <li>User registration and login for personalized dashboards.</li>
      <li>Secure and intuitive interface for easy navigation.</li>
      <li>Documentation for understanding the AI models and logic used.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>As a college project, it also emphasizes teamwork, problem-solving, and technical implementation skills. 
    Each member contributed to designing the system architecture, coding the AI logic, and testing the platform thoroughly. 
    This experience prepares students for real-world applications of AI and web development.</p>

    <p>Through this project, we aim to combine theoretical knowledge from our coursework at Panimalar Engineering College with hands-on practical experience, demonstrating the power of AI in real-world scenarios. 
    We hope that Forex AI can inspire further development and innovation in AI-driven financial tools.</p>

    <p>In conclusion, Forex AI is more than just a college project. It represents the efforts, creativity, and technical skills of our team at Panimalar Engineering College. 
    By showcasing how AI can enhance financial decision-making, we hope to contribute to both educational and technological growth in the field of artificial intelligence.</p>
